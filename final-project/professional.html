    <button class="accordion">What it is</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>Due to an NDA, there will be certain things in this memo that may be slightly changed, or generalized to preserve proprietary information. This summer I interned in Weehawken, New Jersey (greater New York City area), at UBS Financial Services, as a Business Technology Analyst, within Wealth Management Information Technology. I worked on a team of ~10 software engineers (not including an off-shore team) as well as two other business analysts. Our team supported information systems supporting securities backed lending as well as mortgage products. Our team worked on new development projects and change requests to these systems.</p>

    <button class="accordion">What I did</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>As a business analyst, I acted as a medium between software engineers and front end business stakeholders. The front end analyzed how systems were being used, and determined what improvements could be made, or if there was opportunity to develop new applications. After making a preliminary write up of their proposal (business requirement document (BRD)), these stakeholders would come to the business analysts (me) and discuss the feasibility of the project. We would then work together to come up with a final proposal that addressed the business needs, while also being realistic as to what could be developed in timeframe and budget constraints. After a finalized BRD, the business analysts would work with software engineers to help them understand all the components to the project.</p>

    <button class="accordion">What I Learned</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>From a high level, I learned how software is developed at a large financial institution. From analyzing need, to requirement definition, development, testing, and implementation. Along with this, I leaned to understand the different stakeholders at each stage of development. Additionally, I was exposed to concepts of front end / back end web development, user experience, data flows, and project management.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Future Steps</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>At UBS, I was exposed to many different departments and job functions. I learned that within the intersection of finance and information technology there are a plethora of different career paths. Due to this, I believe that UBS offers a great place to start my career. While my role this summer had some exposure to the front, revenue producing, side of the company, it was mostly back end oriented. I want to slowly work my way into a front-end role, while developing technical skills along the way.</p>
